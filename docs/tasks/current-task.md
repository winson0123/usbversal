| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Task ID | `TASK-317` |
| Objective | Library paints before analysis colours finish |
| Completed | 2026-08-30 |

### Scope

- Home OPENING caption is "Opening the DJ USB…", not scanning.
- Library resume returns immediately; crate pass then analysis pass.
- Track preview uses its own worker group so it cannot cancel refresh.

### Verification log

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `.venv/bin/ruff check .` | pass |
| `.venv/bin/ruff format --check .` | pass |
| `.venv/bin/pytest` | 375 passed, 4 skipped |

## Next

Ask the user. Re-sync after Serato has created `location.sqlite` to
flip the library-list blues. Live Serato on this stick uses
`analysis_flags = 24` for loaded tracks, not 31.
